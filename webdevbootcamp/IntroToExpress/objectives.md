#NPM Init and Package.json

* Use the `--save` flag to install packages
	* It will take the package name and version and automatically save it into our `package.json` file if we have one.
* Explain what the package.json file does
* Use `npm init` to create a new package.json
	* `entry point` refers to the file where application starts. In most of our applications, it's going to be `app.js`.
